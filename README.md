# Pepa Linha Dark ichier Adminer-theme

My modifications on the awesome [pepa-linha-dark theme](https://github.com/pepa-linha/Adminer-Design-Dark) for [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org).

I chose the original theme, when i started working with adminer, liked it the most. While the original theme is great for data-presentation, having all that air, i wanted to turn it more into a work-horse. So i made it more dense to show more data and such.
I try to keep it up to date with the latest adminer-version while using it and stumbling across things.

## Installation
copy the `adminer-dark.css` file into your `adminer.php`-folder, maybe rename to or symlink from `adminer.css`
