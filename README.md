# Pepa Linha Dark ichier Adminer-theme

My modifications on the awesome [pepa-linha-dark theme](https://github.com/pepa-linha/Adminer-Design-Dark) for [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org).

I chose the original theme, when i started working with adminer, liked it the most. While the original theme is great for data-presentation, having all that air, i wanted to turn it more into a work-horse. So i made it more dense to show more data and such.
I try to keep it up to date with the latest adminer-version while using it and stumbling across things.

## Installation
1. copy the `adminer.pepa-linha-dark_ichier.css` file somewhere into your `adminer`-folder
2. symlink a new `adminer.css` or `adminer-dark.css` in your `adminer`-root-folder to `adminer.pepa-linha-dark_ichier.css`

alternatively:
1. rename the `adminer.pepa-linha-dark_ichier.css` file to `adminer.css` or `adminer-dark.css`
2. place it on the same level like your `adminer.php` file.
